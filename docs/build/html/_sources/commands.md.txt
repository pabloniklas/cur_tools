# Available Commands

[Source](https://montcs.bloomu.edu/Information/LowLevel/DOS-Debug.html)

## Quit: Q

Immediately quits (exits) the PEBUG program! No questions ever asked... 
should be the first command you remember along with the "?" command.

## Hex: H value1 value2

A very simple (add and subtract only) Hex calculator. 
Never forget that all numbers inside of PEBUG are always Hexadecimal. 
Enter two Hex values (no more than four digits each) and PEBUG shows first the SUM, 
then the DIFFERENCE of those values. Examples:

```-h aaa 531 -h fff 3 -h dbf ace```

## Dump: D [range]

```D [address] [length]```

Displays the contents of a block of memory. 
This first example shows we have a Matrox card in this system.

### Examples:

## Search: S range list

Searches within a range of addresses for a pattern of one or more byte values given in a list.
The list can be comprised of numbers or character strings enclosed by matching single or double quote marks. 

### Examples:

:::

FE00:006F
d fe00:0

## Compare: C range address

Compares two blocks of memory. 
If there are no differences, then PEBUG simply displays another prompt. 
Here's an example of what happens when there are differences:

:::
c 140 148 340
127D:0143 30 6D 127D:0343
127D:0146 10 63 127D:0346
127D:0148 49 30 127D:0348
:::

The bytes at locations 140 through 148 are being compared to those at 340 (through 348, implied); 
the bytes are displayed side by side for those which are different 
(with their exact locations, including the segment, on either side of them). 

## Fill: F range list

This command can also be used to clear large areas of Memory as well as filling 
smaller areas with a continuously repeating phrase or single byte. 

### Example:

:::
f 100 12f 'BUFFER'
d 100 12f
xxxx:0100 42 55 46 46 45 52 42 55-46 46 45 52 42 55 46 46 BUFFERBUFFERBUFF
xxxx:0110 45 52 42 55 46 46 45 52-42 55 46 46 45 52 42 55 ERBUFFERBUFFERBU
xxxx:0120 46 46 45 52 42 55 46 46-45 52 42 55 46 46 45 52 FFERBUFFERBUFFER
:::

## Enter: E address [list]

Used to enter data or instructions (as machine code) directly into Memory locations.

### Example

First we'll change a single byte at location CS:FFCB from whatever it was before to D2


```e ffcb d2```

The next two examples show that either single(') or double(") 
quote marks are acceptable for entering ASCII data. By allowing both forms,
you can include the other type of quote mark within your entry string:

```e 200 'An "ASCII-Z string" is always followed by '```

```e 22a "a zero-byte ('00h')." 00```

## Load: L [address] [firstsector] [number] 

This command will LOAD the selected number of sectors from the vdisk into Memory. 
The address is the location in Memory the data will be copied to 
(use only 4 hex digits to keep it within the memory allocated to PEBUG), 
firstsector counts from ZERO to the largest sector in the volume and finally 
number specifies in hexadecimal the total number of sectors that will be copied into Memory

## Move: M range address

This command should really be called: COPY (not Move) as it actually copies all the bytes from within the specified range to a new address.

### Examples:

1) ```m 7c00 7cff 600```

Copies all the bytes between Offset 7C00 and 7CFF (inclusive) to Offset 0600 and following...

2) ```m 100 2ff 70```

This second example shows that it's very easy to overwrite most of the source you're copying from using
the Move command. 

:::{warning}
PEBUG has protections to avoid overwritting the source bytes.
:::


## Register: R [register]

Entering ```r``` all by itself will display all of the 8086 register's contents 

## Write: W [address] [firstsector] [number]

The WRITE (W) command is often used to save a program to the vdisk.

# Commands I'm working on

## Assemble: A [address]

Creates machine executable code in memory beginning at CS:0100 (or the specified address) from the 8086/8088
(and 8087) Assembly Language instructions which are entered. 
Although no Macro instructions nor labels are recognized, you can use the pseudo-instructions 'DB' and 'DW' 
(so you can use the DB opcode to enter ASCII data like this: DB 'This is a string',0D,0A ).
The 'A' command remembers the last location where any data was assembled, so successive 'A' commands
(when no address is specified) will always begin at the next address in the chain of assembled instructions. 
This aspect of the command is similar to the Dump command which remembers the location of its last dump 
(if no new address is specified).

The assembly process will stop after you ENTER an empty line.

### Example:

:::
A
xxxx:0100 jmp 126
xxxx:0102 db 0d,0a,'This is my first PEBUG program!'
xxxx:0123 db 0d,0a,'$'
xxxx:0126 xor ax,ax
xxxx:0128 mov ah,9
xxxx:012A mov dx,102
xxxx:012D int 21
xxxx:012F mov ax,4c
xxxx:0132 int 21
xxxx:0134
:::

## Unassemble: U [range]

Disassembles machine instructions into 8086 Assembly code. 
Without the optional [range], it uses Offset 100 as its starting point,
disassembles about 32 bytes and then remembers the next byte it should start with if the command is used again.
( The word 'about' was used above, because it may be necessary to finish with an odd-number 
of bytes greater than 32, depending upon the last type of instruction PEBUG has to disassemble.

:::{warning}
The user must decide whether the bytes that PEBUG disassembles are all 8086 instructions, 
just data or any of the newer x86 instructions which are all beyond the ability of PEBUG to understand! 
:::

### Example:

:::
u 126 133
xxxx:0126 31C0 XOR AX,AX
xxxx:0128 B409 MOV AH,09
xxxx:012A BA0201 MOV DX,0102
xxxx:012D CD21 INT 21
xxxx:012F B84C00 MOV AX,004C
xxxx:0132 CD21 INT 21
:::

## Go: G [=address] [addresses]

Go is used to run a program and set breakpoints in the program's code. 
As we saw in an Example for the ENTER command, the '=address' option is used to tell PEBUG a starting location. 
If you use 'g' all by itself, execution will begin at whatever location is pointed to by the CS:IP registers. 
Optional breakpoints ( meaning the program will HALT before executing the code at any of these locations) 
of up to any ten addresses may be set by simply listing them on the command line. 

# Commands in the original DEBUG but not in PEBUG

## Input: I port

The use of I/O commands while running Windowsâ„¢9x/Me is just plain unreliable! This is especially true when trying to directly access hard disks! Under Win NT/2000/XP, the I/O commands are only an emulation; so don't trust them. Though the example below still works under Win2000/XP, it's most likely using some WinAPI code to show what's in the Windows clock area; not directly from an RTC chip.

Long ago (when DOS was the only OS for PCs), there were dozens of BASIC programs that used I/O commands for handling tasks through parallel and serial ports (e.g., to change the font used by a printer or values in a modem's control registers). Under real DOS, they can still be used for direct communications with keyboards or a floppy drive's control chips along with many other hardware devices.
Here's an example of how to read the hours and minutes from a computer's "real time clock" (RTC):

:::
-o 70 04 <-- Check the hours.
-i 71
18 <----- 18 hours (or 6 p.m.)
-o 70 02 <-- Check the minutes.
-i 71
52 <----- 52 minutes
:::

## Output: O port byte

See comments under the Input command.
